NAME
    `Device::BusPirate::Chip::MAX7219' - use a MAX7219 chip with
    `Device::BusPirate'

SYNOPSIS
     use Device::BusPirate;

     my $pirate = Device::BusPirate->new;
     my $max = $pirate->mount_chip( "MAX7219" )->get;

     $max->mode->configure( open_drain => 0 )->get;
     $max->power(1)->get;

     $max->intensity( 2 )->get;
     $max->limit( 8 )->get;

     $max->displaytest( 1 )->get;
     $max->shutdown( 0 )->get;

     sleep 3;

     $max->displaytest( 0 )->get;

DESCRIPTION
    This Device::BusPirate::Chip subclass provides specific communication to
    a Maxim Integrated MAX7219 chip attached to the Bus Pirate via SPI. As
    the MAX7221 chip operates virtually identically, this chip will work
    too.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of this
    chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

METHODS
  $max->write_bcd( $digit, $val )->get
    Writes the value at the given digit, setting it to BCD mode if not
    already so. `$val' should be a single digit number or string, or one of
    the special recognised characters in BCD mode of `-', `E', `H', `L', `P'
    or space. The value may optionally be followed by a decimal point `.',
    which will be set on the display.

    Switches the digit into BCD mode if not already so.

  $max->write_raw( $digit, $bits )->get
    Writes the value at the given digit, setting the raw column lines to the
    8-bit value given.

    Switches the digit into undecoded raw mode if not already so.

  $max->write_hex( $digit, $val )->get
    Similar to `write_bcd', but uses a segment decoder written in code
    rather than on the chip itself, to turn values into sets of segments to
    display. This makes it capable of displaying the letters `A' to `F', in
    addition to numbers, `-' and space.

  $max->set_decode( $bits )->get
    Directly sets the decode mode of all the digits at once. This is more
    efficient for initialising digits into BCD or raw mode, than individual
    calls to `write_bcd' or `write_raw' for each digit individually.

  $max->intensity( $value )->get
    Sets the intensity register. `$value' must be between 0 and 15, with
    higher values giving a more intense output.

  $max->limit( $columns )->get
    Sets the scan limit register. `$value' must be between 1 and 8, to set
    between 1 and 8 digits. This should only be used to adjust for the
    number of LED digits or columns units physically attached to the chip;
    not for normal display blanking, as it affects the overall intensity.

    *Note* that this is not directly the value written to the `LIMIT'
    register.

  $max->shutdown( $off )->get
    Sets the shutdown register, entirely blanking the display and turning
    off all output if set to a true value, or restoring the display to its
    previous content if set false.

    *Note* that this is not directly the value written to the `SHUTDOWN'
    register.

  $max->displaytest( $on )->get
    Sets the display test register, overriding the output control and
    turning on every LED if set to a true value, or restoring normal
    operation if set to false.
